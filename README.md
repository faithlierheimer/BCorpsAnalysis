# BCorpsAnalysis
Does a company's impact score improve or worsen over the course of their tenure of certification?
Our dataset contained a two types of certification data:  1) the company’s initial or “date first certified” and 2) their most recent certification date.  Currently, recertification happens every 3 years; however, until 2018 B-Corps were required to recertify every two years.  
First, we’ll look at average overall score by year, then as average score by certification cycle.

While the first graph shows a deterioration in average score year over year.  The second makes it clear that b corps on average do improve significantly at each certification cycle. This paradox may be explained by graph 3.  From 2011 through 2016 new b corps were added at a much faster pace than existing b corps were being recertified.  The lower score of the first time certifications may have been enough to pull down the entire average.

What industries tend to have higher impact scores?
Another variable we explored was the effect of “sector” on the average over-all score.  B corps are subdivided into 6 different categories or “Sectors” ('Agriculture/Growers', 'Manufacturing', 'Service', 'Service with Minor Environmental Footprint', 'Service with Significant Environmental Footprint' and 'Wholesale/Retail' ). The minimum score needed to maintain certification is 80 and the maximum score possible is 200.  Sectory categories from smallest to largest are as follows: “Service”, “Agriculture” “Service with significant environmental impact”, “Manufacturing”, “Wholesale/Retail” and “Service with minor environmental impact”.

What industries tend to improve their impact score over multiple certification cycles? What industries tend to worsen their impact score over multiple certification cycles?
All sectors with the exception of “Service” (our smallest category) show significant improvement at each successive certification cycle.
